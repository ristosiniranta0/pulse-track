 * Filename: ComplexJavaScriptCode.js
 *
 * This code implements a complex and sophisticated web application that simulates a virtual gallery.
 * It allows users to browse, search, and interact with various artworks.
 * The application is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and utilizes various web technologies and techniques.
 * The code is structured using several classes, modules, and functions, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
 * The virtual gallery showcases different categories of art, such as painting, sculpture, and photography.
 * Users can filter artworks based on the artist, medium, style, or price range.
 * They can also save their favorite artworks, add comments, and share them on social media.
 * In addition, the application integrates an admin panel for managing artworks, artists, and user accounts.
 * The code below is just a simplified representation to provide an overview of the complete project.
